my-theme Theme
===

Namaste (Hello in India), This is a underscores based theme called the my-theme. It is a simple, reposnsive theme with no complex functions.
The following are some of the features of my-theme
=================================================
* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 template.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in `functions.php` and adding the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.
* 2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts/` for a sidebar on either side of your content.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.
* It's named my-theme because it really works the way you want it to! Now that's cool.
